# Multiple Doctors

## Background Story

Dr. Smith's solo practice has grown beyond what he can handle alone. He decides to hire Dr. Jones to help with the patient load. Sarah now faces a new challenge - she needs to manage appointments for two different doctors. The current system assumes only one doctor exists, but Sarah needs to schedule appointments and specify which doctor the patient will be seeing. Each doctor needs their own separate appointment schedule.
