# Basic Appointment Scheduling

## Background Story

Dr. Smith runs a small private practice. His receptionist Sarah has been managing appointments in a paper notebook, but mistakes keep happening - double bookings, illegible handwriting, lost pages. Patients show up to find someone else already in the appointment slot. Dr. Smith needs a simple digital system where Sarah can clearly see the daily schedule and avoid conflicts.
