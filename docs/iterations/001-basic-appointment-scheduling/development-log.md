# Development Log - Basic Appointment Scheduling

## Architecture Overview

### 🏗️ Monolithic Approach

- Single requirement implemented - no boundaries needed yet
- Project named "Evolving Clinic" (not "Evolving Clinic - Appointment Scheduling") - we don't know how it will evolve
- No forced boundaries: let domain complexity drive architecture decisions

## Domain Design

### 🎯 DailyAppointmentSchedule - Aggregate Root

- **Good boundaries**: focused on single day scheduling
- **Contains**: ScheduledAppointment entities - concrete booked appointments
- **Core responsibility**: ensures no two appointments overlap in time
- **Clear invariant**: collision-free scheduling within the day

### 🎯 AppointmentTimeSlot - Value Object

- **Encapsulates time logic**: date + start/end times
- **Key method**: OverlapsWith() - clean overlap detection algorithm
- **Validation**: minimum 15 minutes, start < end time
- **Immutable**: proper value object semantics

## Business Rules & Decisions

### ⏱️ 15-minute Minimum Duration

- **Hardcoded** because no other business requirements exist yet
- **Pragmatic decision**: implement what we know now
- **Future-ready**: easy to make configurable when needed

### 🚫 Collision Detection

- **Algorithm**: `StartTime < other.EndTime && EndTime > other.StartTime`
- **Comprehensive coverage**: all overlap scenarios handled
- **Encapsulated**: logic lives in value object where it belongs

## Testing Strategy

### 🎭 BDD Tests - Business Scenarios

- **Focus**: how system works in real clinic scenarios
- **Future-thinking**: designed to scale with more complex requirements
- **Clean scenarios**: success and failure paths covered
- **Readable**: non-technical stakeholders can understand

### 🧪 Unit Tests - Technical Structure

- **Organized by method**: `[ClassName][MethodName]Tests` pattern
- **Separated concerns**: value object tests vs aggregate tests
- **Comprehensive**: constructor, validation, collision detection

## Technical Decisions

### 📡 Infrastructure

- **In-memory everything**: as per project assumptions
- **No API layer**: rich domain + thin application with CQRS covering use cases
- **Pragmatic choice**: convenient for domain focus

### 🏛️ Application Layer

- **Thin layer**: minimal business logic here
- **Command/Query separation**: clear responsibilities
- **Simple**: just orchestration, domain does the work

## Technical Debt

### 🏗️ Technical Infrastructure

- **No AggregateRoot, Entity etc. base classes**: will implement in future iterations
- **No versioning**: will implement in future iterations
- **No complex abstractions**: focusing on domain complexity first, technical polish later

## Summary

This is just the beginning - **first domain model with minimal business logic**. Great to see actual business rules emerging (collision detection, time validation) even in this simple scenario.

Technical infrastructure kept deliberately simple - **this is the whole point of this project**: have fun with domain modeling without focusing too much on technical aspects. I care about business logic, let infrastructure be naive.
