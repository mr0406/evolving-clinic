# Patient Registration

## Background Story

Sarah has been scheduling appointments using just patient names, but problems are emerging. Last week, she had three different "John Smith" appointments scheduled and couldn't tell them apart when they called to reschedule. When elderly Mrs. Chen had a medical episode during her visit, Dr. Smith needed to contact her emergency contact but had no information beyond her name. Additionally, Sarah realizes she needs basic patient information for insurance purposes and to avoid mix-ups. The clinic needs a proper patient registration system to store essential patient details before appointments can be scheduled.
