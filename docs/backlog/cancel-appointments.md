# Cancel Appointments

## Background Story

Sarah has been using the digital appointment system for scheduling, but patients frequently call to cancel their appointments. Currently, she has no way to remove scheduled appointments from the system. When Mr. Peterson called to cancel his Thursday 2 PM appointment due to illness, Sarah had to keep a separate note since the system only allows adding appointments. She needs the ability to cancel appointments so the schedule accurately reflects availability and she can offer those time slots to other patients.
